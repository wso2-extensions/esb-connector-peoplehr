   		 Give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

   		 NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from peoplehr. (e.g. *.peoplehr.com)
   			    CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. peoplehr)

   	iv)  Navigate to "{PEOPLEHR_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import Shopify certificate in to keystore.
